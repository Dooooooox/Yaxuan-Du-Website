      <strong>Description::</strong><br />
      During the design phase, I created a sense of rhythm and movement that interacted with the viewer's perception of size and space. By resizing the logo to create variation, a sense of breathing is created, drawing the viewer's attention to both the static and dynamic aspects of the visual. The initial stage presents a large static logo, followed by a transition where multiple logos are gradually animated in a grid.

        <strong>The background stories:</strong><br />
        The figure I created has the head of one of the characters from the childhood Chinese animated classic "Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf" - Black Marshal. This cartoon was a huge hit and is still a favorite today.
        The body part is the Chinese national animal, the panda. Pandas are very cute and loved all over the world, even pandas can be used to promote diplomacy.
        The legs are bananas because I love bananas and bananas look like legs!</p>

      I used 'sin(time)' to adjust the size of the changes to be floating to ensure that the movement felt flexible rather than mechanical. I also experimented with a cascading effect using 'frame delay' to control when each part of the illusion appears.

      How might your optical illusion get deployed in the world around you? May it be incorporated into a browser extensionLinks to an external site.? Can it possibly be turned into a piece of wearableLinks to an external site.：

    <p class="description">
      Perhaps it could be incorporated into a browser extension as an interactive backdrop that changes depending on the user's activity.
      Or for a public art installation, projected onto a large screen in an urban space. The cascading animation effect can be a great way to grab the attention of passersby.
