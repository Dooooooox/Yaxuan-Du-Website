      <strong>Design Process::</strong><br />
      First I thought about how the three parts should be put together, since they are basically unrelated and it's kind of weird to put them directly together. I started by simply piecing it together in adobe illustrator, and once I had a rough image spelled out I started to depict it in p5js. It's important to keep the joints of the head, body and legs overly smooth and not have too weird of a size difference.

        <strong>The background stories:</strong><br />
        The figure I created has the head of one of the characters from the childhood Chinese animated classic "Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf" - Black Marshal. This cartoon was a huge hit and is still a favorite today.
        The body part is the Chinese national animal, the panda. Pandas are very cute and loved all over the world, even pandas can be used to promote diplomacy.
        The legs are bananas because I love bananas and bananas look like legs!</p>

      <strong>New backgroundstory:</strong><br />
      This is a 'Black Marshal Chariot' transformed into a 'Black Marshal Chariot' by 'Black Marshal', when faced with danger or emergency, Black Marshal will transform from an egg shape into a 'Black Marshal Chariot', the bottom of which is like a tank-like battle tracks.
