      <strong>Design process:</strong><br />
      First I sketched it through illustrator, first following the sketch in p5. Then I added let color, let scale, random color, mouseX and mouseY, mousePressed and so on.

        In which there will be some problems is that, after adding some programs, the whole code can not run, need to check the problem again and again, may be the position is not right, may be the code before and after the {} order is wrong, may also be the code input program error, in the process of production encountered a lot of problems in the many times to check and learn, have been solved. And some of the code added will affect the original screen layer, I do not know how this is, so I can only delete some of the screen, but the good thing is that the impact is not too big, does not affect the final screen rendering!

      <strong>Discovered:</strong><br />
      I don't think the form I chose was too complicated, the screen I chose was my own portrait both in terms of sketching (probably because of the experience gained from drawing a dragon for the first time) and adding the code. So the whole process faced a lot of problems but most of them could be solved properly and this was still a lot of fun after it all worked.
