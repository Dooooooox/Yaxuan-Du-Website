      <h2>Reflection:</h2>
      <p><strong>Your name:</strong> Du</p>
      <p><strong>Your partner’s name:</strong> Ruby</p>
      <p class="description">
        <strong>The object description you received:</strong><br />
        "A skateboard: a black, mid-sized cruiser board with a large red and gold dragon image across the entire underside of the deck. Large red wheels and sparkly black griptape adorn the board - it is classic, yet highly decorative.."
      </p>
        <p class="description">
        <strong>The language your partner used to describe the image:</strong><br />
        Ruby's description of the object is very detailed, not only describing the location of different parts of the object, but also stating its relative size and specific color. This was very helpful in determining the approximate shape and saved me a lot of effort when I drew it further!
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        <strong>Your interpretation of the image:</strong><br />
        First I understood that this was a skateboard with a decorative pattern and I started by drawing the skateboard shape. For the pattern of the skateboard, the dragon, made it more tricky for me. I searched the internet and found a lot of reference patterns for dragons, and finally chose one that I was happy with as the final reference. At first I thought of making a cartoon dragon, but it didn't turn out well and didn't look very pretty, so I decided to challenge myself and draw a more complex dragon!

        <strong>The depiction of the image using code:</strong><br />
        The skateboard is relatively simple and easy to draw, not too difficult. But the dragon pattern on the skateboard was more difficult. Since this was just the beginning of the course, I didn't learn the complex code. Even though I had learned arduino before, there were differences between the two, and I had never used code to draw such complex patterns before. This was very frustrating for me and I didn't want to start this assignment the other day because it was too difficult.
I then started to try and I asked gpt how it should be drawn and learned the code for beginShape, endShape and vertex. I also learned the codes push,pop,rotate,translate in last week's class and I also asked my teacher who taught me scale and bezier for arcs. When I got home, I started to try it again, and this time I applied a lot of new knowledge and added my own understanding, in many places I integrated more than one graphic, in some places I used the method of contrasting colors, and so on. But no matter what, the pattern is still very complex, and I'm getting better and better as I try and try, and little by little I'm able to complete this complex pattern!

      <p class="description">
        <strong>The differences in interpretation at all stages of the assignment:</strong><br />
        This ASSIGNMENT cycle is long and has many different phases. It was easier to confirm the shapes in the first stage, and more difficult to make the finer ones in the middle and late stages. There was a lot of new code to be learned and mastered before it could be completed. Of course the current look will be different from Ruby's skateboard, but I've tried my best to finish it!
